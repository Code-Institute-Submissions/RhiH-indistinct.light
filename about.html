    <h4 class="header">About the Project:</h4>
    <p class="about-project">Rhian says, "The project started during lockdown and following shielding advice. During the day going out was problematic as I was caring for a family member whose health deteriorated over the lockdown period. Going out, late at night to check the security of my car was the only time I had any real quiet moment to myself. I began to take my camera with me, as I have a fascination with images of light trails left in the dark, and decided I would document my 5 minutes of peace.</p>
    <p class="about-project">Each night, after 10pm, I would head out to check on my car, and enjoy the stillness of the area. I walked along the main road, purposely setting my camera to not use the flash and the auto-function.</p>
    <p class="about-project">As I walked, I rarely encountered other people, and vehicles seemed to fly past me, leaving only light trails as though they were never there to begin with. It was peaceful, but in an eerie fashion, as you never knew whether the shadows you thought were fixed would transform into a figure, human or otherwise. Sometimes there would be cats,  mice or rats spotted in the undergrowth, hearing foxes and owls in the distance. As I walked I regained the equilibrium to continue with my caring responsibilites the next day. But sometimes I wanted to keep walking." </p>
