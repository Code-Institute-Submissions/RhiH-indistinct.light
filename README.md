Indistinct Light

Indistinct Light was a photography project from late December 2020 to June 2021. It focused on images taken on the same route around the same time each night. One of the issues regarding the project was how to present the work to a wider audience when the majority of the work has never been in a gallery setting, and indeed many of the images remain virtual and have never been printed.

A website to display the images and explain the project was the best solution, however when I have previously looked at hosting options nothing seemed to suit the requirements I would liked them to have met.
