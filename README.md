# Indistinct Light

Indistinct Light was a photography project from late December 2020 to June 2021. It focused on images taken on the same route around the same time each night. One of the issues regarding the project was how to present the work to a wider audience when the majority of the work has never been in a gallery setting, and indeed many of the images remain virtual and have never been printed.

A website to display the images and explain the project was the best solution, however when I have previously looked at hosting options nothing seemed to be exactly what I wanted to show off the work in the best way possible.


Planning the Project Website:

What is the Target Audience?

Clients who have an interest in the artist's work and wanting to see more of it.
Gallery owners/Artist reps who wish to see the work prior to any commitments e.g. offering space within their gallery or promoting the artist.
Other artists/creators who wish to see the work and work collaboratively together on future projects. 
Photography enthusiasts who have an interest in the type of photography undertaken.
Casual users who are not familiar with the artist's work or the type of work displayed here.

Target Audience Requirements:

As a user I would like to have more information about the project and artist.
As a user I would like to be able to contact the artist directly.
As a user I would like the site to not detract from the images.
As a user I would like the site to be easy to navigate.


Website Aims:

To be a vehicle for advertising the skillset of the artist.
To be a portal for users to learn more about the project.
To be an ongoing promotional tool for the artist and project.
To project a professional and considered image for the artist and project.
To maintain high standards across all styling features.
To provide interested users a way of contacting the artist directly.

Other considerations:

All images must be responsive across devices. The photographs will need to be re-sized to ensure the loading speed is not an issue.
Explanations around the project and artist must be clear and succinct. The text is an essential part of explaining the work and therefore consideration must be taken in regards to the location, content, length and tone of any text on the site.
Styling is an essential consideration - all elements regarding this - colour, font, links etc must be cohesive and consistent. 

Ensuring the Aims and Considerations are Achieved:

A key part of the design was to keep in mind the website aims. Each part of the website needed to reflect a professional approach to promote the artist. To achieve this wireframes were used early on in the planning, to give a structured form of what the site structure needed to achieve. 

WIREFRAMES

These were created to have a flexible approach in terms of the structure, as the design would be amended as needed during the creation of the site as the development of it progressed.
