Indistinct Light

Indistinct Light was a photography project from late December 2020 to June 2021. It focused on images taken on the same route around the same time each night. One of the issues regarding the project was how to present the work to a wider audience when the majority of the work has never been in a gallery setting, and indeed many of the images remain virtual and have never been printed.

A website to display the images and explain the project was the best solution, however when I have previously looked at hosting options nothing seemed to be exactly what I wanted to show off the work in the best way possible.


Planning the Project Website:

What is the Target Audience?

Gallery owners who wish to see the work prior to any commitment to offering space within their gallery.
Clients who have an interest in my work through other areas and wishing to see more of it.
Photography enthusiasts who have an interest in the type of photography I have undertaken.
Casual users who are not familiar with my work or the type of work displayed here.

Target Audience Requirements:

As a user I would like the site to be easy to navigate.
As a user I would like the site to not detract from the images.
As a user I would like to have more information about the project and artist.
As a user I would like to be able to contact the artist directly.




other considerations included how best to display my images, how to make them responsive across all devices, not least when the images I have are very large. How to explain the project as the images themselves, whilst interesting, did not have enough information without additional text about the project somewhere on site.
